The top example shows how you can insert a column of checkboxes into a table, and obtain their values in Shiny. The selected rows are plotted as solid points on the scatterplot. First, we appended the `cars` data with a column of checkboxes via `appendCheckboxes()`. The `options` argument of `datatable()` disabled the ordering of this column (since it does not make much sense to order these checkboxes), and `escape = -4` means the 4th column should not be escaped since it is supposed to be raw HTML.

The bottom example shows you can also use checkboxes as the "row names" of the data, and the indices of the selected rows are printed on the right.
