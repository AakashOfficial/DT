title: Using DT in Shiny
---

---

You can render a table widget in shiny, and obtain some information about its current state, such as the indices of the rows on the current page. Note these information are currently not available if you are using the [server-side processing](server.html) mode (i.e. when `datatable(server = TRUE)`).

# A Minimal Example

Here is a minimal example of (client-side) DataTables in Shiny using the convenience functions `dataTableOutput()` and `renderDataTable()` in **DT** (instead of **shiny**):

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(DT::dataTableOutput('tbl')),
  server = function(input, output) {
    output$tbl = DT::renderDataTable({
      DT::datatable(iris, options = list(lengthChange = FALSE))
    })
  }
)
```

If you have used the `renderDataTable()` function in **shiny** before, please note that the function with the same name in **DT** should take a widget as the input instead of a data object. Please compare the usage of **shiny** with **DT** carefully below:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
renderDataTable(iris, options = list(
  pageLength = 5,
  initComplete = I('function(setting, json) { alert("done"); }')
))
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(DT)
renderDataTable({
  datatable(iris, options = list(
    pageLength = 5,
    initComplete = JS('function(setting, json) { alert("done"); }')
  ))
})
```

The main differences are:

1. The first argument of `shiny::renderDataTable()` is a data object, whereas `DT::renderDataTable()` expects a table _widget_ returned by `datatable()`;
1. The `options` argument is passed to `renderDataTable()` in **shiny**, and to `datatable()` in **DT**;
1. When you want to write literal JavaScript code, you use `I()` in **shiny**, but you have to use `JS()` in **DT**;

# Interaction with Shiny

There are some information exposed to Shiny from the table widget as you interact with the table in Shiny. In the following sections, we use `foo` to denote the output id of the table (i.e. the `outputId` in `dataTableOutput()`). You need to replace `foo` with the actual id of the table in your own app.

## Row Selection

The feature of row selection is enabled automatically when a table is embedded in a Shiny app. You can click on a row to toggle its selection status, and the indices of the selected rows are available through `input$foo_rows_selected`. See [a live example here](https://yihui.shinyapps.io/DT-rows/).

```{r eval=FALSE}
# you can find the example locally in the DT package
app = system.file('examples', 'DT-rows', package = 'DT')
shiny::runApp(app)
```

Note `input$foo_rows_selected` is the numeric indices of the selected rows when the table is processed on the client side. For server-side processing, there is no way to obtain the numeric indices because **DT** does not know the full table: only one page of the table data is returned from the server, and we have no idea the n-th row on a page is which row in the full table (by comparison, client-side tables fully live in the web browser). A workaround in this case is to use the row names as the indices. You must turn on the display of row names by `datatable(data, rownames = TRUE)` (in most cases, this is just the default behavior) if you want to get the names of selected rows from `input$foo_rows_selected`.

## DataTables Information

As you interact with the table (e.g. sort columns, search the table, or navigate through pages), **DT** will expose some information about the current state of the table to Shiny. At the moment, these information are available in the `input` object of the Shiny server function (suppose the table output id is `foo`):

- `input$foo_rows_current`: the indices of rows on the current page
- `input$foo_rows_all`: the indices of rows on all pages (after the table is filtered by the search strings)
- `input$foo_state`: the state information of the table (a list containing the search string, ordering and paging information; it is available only if the option `stateSave = TRUE` is applied to the table)

[This example](https://yihui.shinyapps.io/DT-info/) shows how you can make use of these information to highlight points on a scatterplot and download the filtered data.

```{r eval=FALSE}
app = system.file('examples', 'DT-info', package = 'DT')
shiny::runApp(app)
```
